<h1>What makes SBU physics unique?</h1>

<p>Stony Brook isn't the only university offering physics degrees. Why come here instead of somewhere else? 
    In a word, research.</p>

<h3>We're a Big Research University</h3>

<p>As a large research university, nearly every professor is actively pursuing his or her own topic of research 
    while lecturing. As such, the demand for undergraduate assistance is relatively high. We cannot understate how
     important undergraduate research experience is when applying to graduate school. It is not an opportunity 
     physics students in smaller universities typically experience.</p>

<h3>Proximity to BNL</h3>

<p>Barely 10 miles from the university is Brookhaven National Laboratory. It has a wide range of facilities, 
    from particle accelerators to nanomaterial shops to supercomputers. Some of the professors here are 
    partnered with the lab, and still other independent opportunities exist outside of the university staff.
     If you've ever wanted to work with government-grade toys, this might be your chance. Visit
     <a href  = "https://www.bnl.gov/science/">their website</a> for more information.

<h3>A Small Major</h3>

<p>With about 50 graduates a year, Stony Brook’s undergraduate physics department is on the smaller side,
     despite the size of the university. This means that class sizes after freshman year are very manageable. 
     It gives the chance to build relationships with professors, which are useful for letters of recommendation,
      research opportunities, and more. You’ll also get to know and network with most of your peers.</p>

<h3>Theoretical/Experimental Split</h3>

<p>A common point of contention among undergraduates pursuing PhDs is whether one focuses on developing 
    theory or performing experiments. Stony Brook will offer you a glimpse into both realms. Most classes
     focus on theoretical understanding, while the accompanying lab courses provide useful exercises in
      experimental setup and data analysis. </p>

<p>Additionally, our professors research a wide range of topics, both theoretical and experimental, and are
     always in search of undergraduate help. To better prepare yourself for research, it is also convenient
      to double-major in either our MAT (pure mathematics for theory) or AMS (applied math/statistics for analysis).
       These courses slot in neatly with the physics major, and will widen your base of mathematical understanding. 
       If you’re looking to become a theorist, experimentalist, undecided, or neither, we have something for you. </p>
