        <div class="container clearfix"><h1>Summer Research Opportunities</h1>

<p>There are many paid internships out there if you are looking to gain research experience over the summer months. Don't know where to start? Here's a list of programs we're familiar with.</p>

<h3>URECA Summer Program/Explorations in STEM/Frances Velay Fellowship</h3>

<p>The Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) Department funds Stony Brook students doing full-time faculty mentored research over the summer. Applicants must seek out a faculty mentor prior to applying. As of 2022, there are three programs to choose from: Explorations in STEM, which is geared towards freshmen/sophomores and includes weekly professional development workshops; URECA, which is geared towards experienced researchers; and Frances Velay Women and Science Research Fellowship, which is designed specifically for women STEM majors and heavily encouraged towards those with less research experience. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/summer/urecasummer.php">here.</a></p>

<p>Many universities have their own university-funded programs similar to URECA/Explorations in STEM. Visit individual universities' undergraduate research or physics research websites to learn more.</p>

<h3>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs)</h3>

<p>REU programs are hosted by individual universities with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). US Citizenship or Permanent Residency is required for eligibility. You can find a link to NSF's search engine of Physics REUs <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=69">here.</a> Stony Brook also has their own REU program, whose link you can find <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/physics-reu/">here.</a></p>

<h3>Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI)</h3>

<p>SULI programs are hosted at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories and facilities. There are internship terms during the fall, spring, and summer. US Citizenship or Permanent Residency is required for eligibility. You can find a link to SULI's website <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli">here.</a></p>

<h3>NASA Internships</h3>

<p>NASA hosts a variety of internships for undergraduate and graduate students. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://intern.nasa.gov/">here.</a></p>

<h3>Amgen Scholars</h3>

<p>The Amgen Scholars Program hosts research opportunities at 24 institutions around the world. Eligibility depends on the selected institution. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://amgenscholars.com/">here.</a></p>

<h3>Research Internships in Science and Engineering (RISE) Germany</h3>

<p>The German Academic Exchange Service connects undergraduates with STEM internship offers from top German universities and research institutions. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-germany/">here.</a></p>

<h3>University of Tokyo Research Internship Program (UTRIP)</h3>

<p>UTRIP provides research work experience in a variety of STEM topics at the University of Tokyo alongside many social and cultural programs to learn more about Japan. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://www.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/utrip/welcome/">here.</a></p>

<h3>Caltech LIGO Summer Research Fellowship (SURF)</h3>

<p>If you're especially interested in astrophysics, especially gravitational waves, the LIGO SURF program is for you. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/LIGO_web/students/SURF/">here.</a></p>
