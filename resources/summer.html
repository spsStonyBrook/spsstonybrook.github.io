    <div class="container clearfix"><h1>Summer Research Opportunities</h1>

<p>There are many paid internships out there if you are looking to gain research experience over the summer months. Don't know where to start? Here's a list of programs we're familiar with.</p>

<h3>URECA Summer Program/Explorations in STEM</h3>

<p>The Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) Department funds Stony Brook students doing full-time faculty mentored research over the summer. Applicants must seek out a faculty mentor prior to applying. There are two programs to choose from: Explorations in STEM, which is geared towards freshmen/sophomores and includes weekly professional development workshops, and URECA, which is geared towards experienced researchers. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/summer/urecasummer.php">here.</a></p>

<p>Many universities have their own university-funded programs similar to URECA/Explorations in STEM. Visit individual universities' undergraduate research or physics research websites to learn more. </p>

<h3>Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs)</h3>

<p>REU programs are hosted by individual universities with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). US Citizenship or Permanent Residency is required for eligibility. You can find a link to NSF's search engine of Physics REUs <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=69">here.</a></p>

<h3>Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI)</h3>

<p>SULI programs are hosted at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories and facilities. There are internship terms during the fall, spring, and summer. US Citizenship or Permanent Residency is required for eligibility. You can find a link to SULI's website <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli">here.</a></p>

<h3>NASA Internships</h3>

<p>NASA hosts a variety of internships for undergraduate and graduate students. You can find a link to their website <a href="https://intern.nasa.gov/">here.</a></p>

<h3>Amgen Scholars</h3>
