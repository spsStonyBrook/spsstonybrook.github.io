        <h1>\(\LaTeX\) Workshop</h1>
        These were written to accompany a GBM tutorial by Mike Wahl and Dan Waxman, but hopefully should be a decent reference in the future regardless. We'll also embed a recording of the meeting later. There's a corresponding document <a href="">here</a>, but most examples can be edited from this webpage directly.
        <h2>What is \(\LaTeX\)?</h2>
        <p>\(\LaTeX\) is a markup language, similar in theory to HTML/CSS. Just as the internet is built upon HTML/CSS, high-quality typeset papers in math and physics are often built upon \(\LaTeX\). It builts upon \(\TeX\), built by Don Knuth in the late 70s and 80s, after getting annoyed with the typsetting issues writing the first few volumes of <em>The Art of Computer Programming.</em></p>
        <p>Somewhat confusingly, we type out our documents in \(\LaTeX\), then pass it to a program named something similar like <tt>pdfTeX</tt>, which converts our markup into a pretty, readable format. In physics classes, most people end up using \(\LaTeX\) for professional-looking lab reports, but people also make <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/coursework.html">beautiful lecture notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV">awesome resumes.</a></p>

        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <p>Simply put, it makes life easier. Juxtaposed to many word processors, \(\LaTeX\) just works; after learning what you should type, it's not very often you have to change anything for it to render nicely, it's already nice. Instead of taking ten minutes to type the wave equation, it takes ten seconds and looks great. In order to render \[\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2},\] we just need to type \[\tt{\backslash nabla\verb!^! 2\, f = \backslash frac\{1\}\{c\verb!^!2\} \backslash frac\{\backslash partial\verb!^!2 \, f\}\{\backslash partial \, t\verb!^!2\}}.\]</p>

        <h2>Packages</h2>
        <p>One of the most miraculous aspects of \(\LaTeX\) is the community surrounding it. While some things are somewhat combersome in straight-up \(\LaTeX\), we can use some other people's code to make our lives easier with <em>packages</em>.</p>

        <p>At the top of the reference document, you'll see a number of packages being used. Things like <tt>graphicx</tt> make inserting figures easy, while other packages like <tt>siunitx</tt> help make the process of writing out units much easier.</p>

        <h2>General Navigation</h2>
        Something about text mode vs. math mode, counters, etc.

        <h2>Equations</h2>
        <p>Finally, the place where \(\LaTeX\) shines. It shines so bright that when Microsoft was looking to make writing equations easier, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/linear-format-equations-using-unicodemath-and-latex-in-word-2e00618d-b1fd-49d8-8cb4-8d17f25754f8">they implemented many of the basic \(\LaTeX\) commands</a>. To help out here, we've made it so you can edit stuff in here and see the results live. Feel free to edit any of the examples below and see the results!</p>

        <p>We'll start off with some integrals, which you'll end up typing a lot in physics. Everything starts with the wonderful <tt>\int</tt> command, which creates the familiar looking S. We can add limits of integration (or in fact, general sub- and super-scripts) using the caret <tt>^</tt> and underscore <tt>_</tt>.</p>

        <div class="grid-50-50">
            <textarea class="integral" cols="30" rows="10">S = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} S(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt.</textarea>

            <div id="integral">\[S = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} S(q, \dot{q}, t) \, dt.\]</div>
        </div>
        <p>There's a few little useful tricks in the last exmaple which are worth exploring. For one, it's not too hard to see that writing <tt>\int_t_0^t_1</tt> would be terrible ambiguous, which computers hate. So when you want to <em>group</em> things together in \(\LaTeX\), you can just slap on some curly braces. </p>

        <p>For spacing purposes, we added <tt>\,</tt> before the differential \(dt\) as well --- you can play around with this above to see what the difference looks like. </p>

        <p>Another thing we used is the Newtonian notation for derivative, <tt>\dot{q}</tt>. If we wanted, say, the second derivative, we could use <tt>\ddot{q}</tt> instead. So Newton's Second Law would look like</p>
        <div class="grid-50-50">
            <textarea class="Newton2" cols="30" rows="10">\vec{F} = m\ddot{q}.</textarea>

            <div id="Newton2">\[\vec{F} = m\ddot{q}.\]</div>
        </div>
        <p>(Here, we found another useful little symbol: <tt>\vec{v}</tt>.)</p>
        <p>While on the topic of symbols, Greek letters are everywhere in physics. For Greek letters, you can use <tt>\letter</tt> for the lowercase and <tt>\Letter</tt> for uppercase in math mode. The only exception is when letters are the same in Greek and English, so things like <tt>\Alpha</tt> don't mean anything. In this example, we'll also see fractions for the first time, where the syntax is just <tt>\frac{numerator}{denominator}</tt>.</p>
        <div class="grid-50-50">
            <textarea class="greek" cols="30" rows="10">\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \Gamma(s) \zeta(s).</textarea>

            <div id="greek">\[\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx = \Gamma(s) \zeta(s).\]</div>
        </div>
        <p>Obviously, typesetting homework is nice; if nothing else it makes your work easier to read for the TA. But here you'll have to show your work! You can do this sort of thing with the <tt>align</tt> environment.</p>
        <div class="grid-50-50">
            <textarea class="alignInt" cols="30" rows="10">>\begin{align}
    U_0 &= 2 \sum_{n \leq n_F} \epsilon_n \\
    &= \pi \int_0^{n_F}dn\, n^2 \epsilon_n \\
    &= \frac{\pi^3}{2m} \left(\frac{\hbar}{L}\right)^2 \int_0^{n_F} dn\, n^4.
\end{align} </textarea>

            <div id="alignInt">\[\begin{align}

                &= \frac{\pi^3}{2m} \left(\frac{\hbar}{L}\right)^2 \int_0^{n_F} dn\, n^4.
