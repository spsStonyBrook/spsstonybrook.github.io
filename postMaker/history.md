# A Brief History of Our Organization

The Stony Brook University Chapter charter was adopted on April 22, 1968, and its first members inducted into Sigma Pi Sigma just over a year later, on May 12, 1969. Throughout the 50-plus years since, members of SPS have been a constant in the university’s undergraduate physics program.

In September of 2013, Abmael Olivera, then a Freshman in the major, was elected President of the chapter. Under his presidency, the organization’s room in the Physics Building, P-120, which had historically been reserved for administrative purposes only, was opened as a common area for all members to utilize and foster a closer connection amongst those in the major. This room remained a constant in the day-to-day lives of our members, serving as a place for hanging out, doing work, and meeting new friends, until the University was shut down in March 2020 due to COVID-19.

The period of 2013-2017 showed a strengthening of the bonds between members, forming SPS into a tight-knit community. It was in 2017 that the organization’s outreach began to increase to match. Over the next two years, SPS would more than double average meeting attendance, expanding the base of members while also working with other organizations to host events.

In 2019, the Chapter began outreach through events such as AstroFest and CommUniversity Day, as well as applying for and receiving the Marsh W. White award to work with local high schools. We also hosted Brad Conrad, the President of SPS National, increasing our connections with the National Organization.

To meet with the increase in activities and seriousness of the organization, a new Constitution was written in this time.

Come the spring of 2020 and the shutdown of the University due to COVID-19, SPS switched to online weekly meetings, continuing our years of tradition without hesitation.

Over the years, the National Organization has recognized our Chapter many times for its achievements, especially in the years since 2014. The following are our accolades and awards:
