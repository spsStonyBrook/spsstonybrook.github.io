# Double-Majoring in Astronomy

Physics and astronomy have been intertwined since the beginning of time (literally). At Stony Brook University, there is much overlap between the two majors, so students interested in astrophysics often end up completing both majors. Here, we've listed out the additional courses one would need to complete the double major, depending on whether they start out as a PHY or AST major.

## Starting from Physics and adding Astronomy
- Astronomy (AST 203)- An introduction to the major fields of astronomy and the first rigorous course astronomy majors take. Offered both spring and fall. Prerequisites: Introductory Physics (PHY 125/133, or PHY 131/133 or PHY 141/133).
- Three of the following- Stars & Radiation (AST 341), Galaxies (AST 346), Cosmology (AST 347), and Special Topics in Astronomy (AST 390):
  - AST 341- Offered alternating fall semesters (Next offered: Fall 2022). Prerequisites: Astronomy (AST 203), Modern Physics (PHY 251/252), Computation for Physics and Astronomy (PHY 277), Calculus III (MAT 203, MAT 205, AMS 261, or MAT 307).
  - AST 346: Offered alternating spring semesters (Next offered: Spring 2023). Prerequisites: Astronomy (AST203), Modern Physics (PHY 251/252), Calculus III (MAT 203, MAT 211, MAT 307, or AMS 261).
  - AST 347: Offered alternating fall semesters (Next offered: Fall 2021). Prerequisites: Astronomy (AST 203), Modem Physics (PHY 251/252).
- AST 390: Offered alternating spring semesters and occasionally elsewhere (Next offered: Spring 2022) Prerequisites: Astronomy (AST 203), Modern Physics (PHY 251/252), Calculus III (MAT 203, MAT 211, MAT 307, or AMS 261).
- Six additional credits of astronomy courses: Taking the last of the above four counts, as well as AST205 (Planetary Sciences) or astronomy research.
- Eight credits of astronomy-related courses: Physics covers all of these, with E&M (PHY 301), Mechanics (PHY 303), Quantum Physics (PHY 308), and Electronics Lab (PHY 335).
- Writing Requirement: One of the papers is replaced by the Physics writing requirement, so only one Astronomy paper is required. Most people complete this in their junior year.
Total: 19 credits. The full undergraduate bulletin can be found [here.](https://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/bulletin/current/academicprograms/ast/degreesandrequirements.php)

## Starting from Astronomy and adding Physics
- Electromagnetic Theory I (PHY 301): Offered each fall. Prerequisites: Modern Physics (PHY 251), Computation (PHY 277), Calculus III (MAT 203, MAT 205, AMS 261, or MAT 307).
- Mechanics (PHY 303): Offered each fall. Prerequisites: Modern Physics (PHY 251), Computation (PHY 277), Calculus IV (AMS 361, MAT 303, MAT 305, or MAT 308).
- Quantum Physics (PHY 308): Offered each spring. Prerequisites: Waves & Optics (PHY 300), Electromagnetic Theory I (PHY 301), and Mechanics (PHY 303).
- Linear Algebra (MAT 211 or AMS 210 or MAT 307): Offered every semester. Prerequisites for MAT 211 and AMS 210: Calculus I (Level 7 on placement exam, AMS 151, MAT 131, or MAT 141).
Total: 15 credits. The full undergraduate bulletin can be found [here.](https://www.stonybrook.edu/sb/bulletin/current/academicprograms/phy/degreesandrequirements.php)

Notes:
- Physics Senior Lab can be replaced by Astronomy Senior Lab.
- While taking one of the 300-level astronomy courses first semester sophomore year is possible in some cases, it is not recommended.
