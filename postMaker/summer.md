# Summer Research Opportunities

There are many paid internships out there if you are looking to gain research experience over the summer months. Don't know where to start? Here's a list of programs we're familiar with.

### URECA Summer Program/Explorations in STEM

The Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) Department funds Stony Brook students doing full-time faculty mentored research over the summer. Applicants must seek out a faculty mentor prior to applying. There are two programs to choose from: Explorations in STEM, which is geared towards freshmen/sophomores and includes weekly professional development workshops, and URECA, which is geared towards experienced researchers. You can find a link to their website [here.](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/summer/urecasummer.php)

Many universities have their own university-funded programs similar to URECA/Explorations in STEM. Visit individual universities' undergraduate research or physics research websites to learn more. 

### Research Experience for Undergraduates (REUs)

REU programs are hosted by individual universities with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). US Citizenship or Permanent Residency is required for eligibility.
