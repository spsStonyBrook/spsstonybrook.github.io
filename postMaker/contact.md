# Join Us

There are no pre-requisites for joining our organization. Simply be a Stony Brook student and start showing up to our meetings!

We use Discord as our primary means of announcing meetings and communicating with members. To be added to our Discord, send us an email to sps.sbu[at]gmail.com.

### Getting Involved

We often get asked, "How can I participate in SPS beyond general body meetings?" Every semester, we have projects and event planning going on behind the scenes, ranging from designing physics lab kits for local high school students, to building a cardboard boat for Roth Regatta, to writing up this very website. We announce these opportunities at meetings, but if you happen to miss them, ask an executive board member what plans we have for the semester. As a member, you are also free to propose a project, event, or collaboration for our chapter to participate in anytime.

At the end of the spring semester, we hold our executive board elections. Joining the SPS Executive Board is the most direct way to ensure your voice is heard in deciding our chapter's direction and activities. Be on the lookout for announcements about elections in the late spring, and start getting to know your fellow members!
