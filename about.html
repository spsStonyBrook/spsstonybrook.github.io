        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>SPS National</h2>
        <p>
            The Society of Physics Students is a professional association within the
            American Institute of Physics. It is designed explicitly to ensure the professional
            success of those with interests in the fields of physics. Membership in the
            National Organization, while not a requirement for membership within the Chapter,
            provides many benefits. You can see those benefits and learn more on
            <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/about/membership">the SPS National website.</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Stony Brook Chapter</h2>
        <p>
            The Stony Brook Chapter of the Society of Physics Students aims to foster the
            academic, professional, and social growth of its members by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing a welcoming undergraduate support network for an active, engaged,
                and diverse membership</li>
            <li>Disseminating physics research, especially that conducted at Stony Brook
                University, through undergraduate level lectures and demonstrations</li>
            <li>Advancing career development by hosting training workshops and promoting
                opportunities for success</li>
            <li>Encouraging interest in physics in our local communities through effective
                physics education</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Our Mission, as written in our Constitution, is: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To encourage all students interested in the Fields of Physics</li>
            <li>To facilitate the professional development of all members</li>
            <li>To advance the local communityâ€™s interest in Physics</li>
            <li>To develop a community within the student body who themselves demonstrate
                the core values of SPS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We seek to carry out this mission through a combination of regularly-scheduled
            meetings and extemporaneous projects designed to contribute to personal and
            professional development; these often taking the form of invited speakers and
            student workshops, as well as campus and community service events. When combined
            with our unique culture, they serve to make our organization a central figure in the
            campus life of physics majors during their time at Stony Brook University.</p>
