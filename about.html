  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>SPS National</h2>
  <p>
    The Society of Physics Students is a professional association within the 
    American Institute of Physics. It is designed explicitly to ensure the professional 
    success of those with interests in the fields of physics. Membership in the 
    National Organization, while not a requirement for membership within the Chapter, 
    provides many benefits. You can see those benefits and learn more at
    <a href="https://www.spsnational.org/about/membership"></a>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our Mission, as written in our Constitution, is:      
      <ul>
        <li>To encourage all students interested in the Fields of Physics</li>
        <li>To facilitate the professional development of all members</li>
        <li>To advance the local communityâ€™s interest in Physics</li>
        <li>To develop a community within the student body who themselves demonstrate 
            the core values of SPS</li>
      </ul>

      We seek to carry out this mission through a combination of regularly-scheduled 
      meetings and extemporaneous projects designed to contribute to personal and 
      professional development; these often taking the form of invited speakers and
      student workshops, as well as campus and community service events. When combined 
      with our unique culture, they serve to make our organization a central figure in the 
      campus life of physics majors during their time at Stony Brook University.
